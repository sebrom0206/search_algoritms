Vary size, probability, seed in file make_grid.py. Which of the heuristics you have
programmed do you think works best?
Are any of the heuristics admissible so that you
have an A* algorithm.

The heuristic that calculates the difference between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates
of each position (node) and the target position, and then use the larger of these two values times three.
- the difference_times_three heuristic from task 5 works the best when looking at the time perspective.

The heuristicÂ´s DifferenceH and EuclideanH are admissible algorithms for A*,
their cost is lower than or equal to the actual cost of reaching the goal state.
